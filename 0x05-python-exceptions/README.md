Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on exceptions in Python. Exceptions are used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. The goal is to understand how to use try, except, finally, and else blocks to catch and handle exceptions in a controlled way, preventing the program from crashing and allowing for graceful error handling.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax and control structures (loops, conditions).

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).

Familiarity with Pythonâ€™s error messages and debugging techniques.
