Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on understanding importing modules in Python. Modules are a way to organize code into separate files and make it reusable. The goal is to learn how to import built-in Python modules as well as how to create and import custom modules. This will help you write modular, maintainable code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax and structure.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).

Familiarity with Pythonâ€™s file system and directory structure for module creation.
