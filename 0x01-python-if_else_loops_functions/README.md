Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on understanding and implementing if, else conditions and loops in Python. These are fundamental programming concepts used to control the flow of a program, allowing for decision-making and repetition of tasks. The goal is to help you master the use of conditional statements and loops to write more dynamic and interactive Python programs.

Learning Objectives
Understand how to use if, else, and elif statements to control the flow of a program based on conditions.

Learn how to use for and while loops to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Understand the difference between while and for loops and when to use each.

Learn how to use loops in combination with conditional statements for more complex decision-making.

Understand break and continue statements to control loop execution.
