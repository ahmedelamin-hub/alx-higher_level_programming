Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on objects in Python. Objects are instances of classes, and they represent real-world entities or concepts. The goal is to understand how to create objects, access their attributes, and utilize methods associated with them. This will enhance your ability to work with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and write more modular, reusable, and maintainable Python code.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax, variables, and functions.

Familiarity with classes and the concept of object-oriented programming.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).
