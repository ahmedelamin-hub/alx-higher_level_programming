Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on more advanced concepts of classes in Python. The goal is to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) by exploring additional features of classes, such as class inheritance, polymorphism, class methods, static methods, and magic methods. This will help you build more complex and flexible systems using Python's OOP features.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax, classes, and object-oriented programming principles.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).

Familiarity with basic concepts such as inheritance, methods, and constructors.
