Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development process where tests are written before the code that implements the functionality. The goal is to learn how to write unit tests using Python's built-in unittest framework, and how to develop code in a way that ensures it is testable and reliable.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax and functions.

Familiarity with Pythonâ€™s unittest framework or willingness to learn.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).

Knowledge of basic software testing concepts, such as unit tests, assertions, and test cases.
