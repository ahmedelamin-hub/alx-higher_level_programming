Description
This repository contains an assignment focused on classes in Python. Classes are the blueprint for creating objects (instances) and allow for the encapsulation of data and behavior. The goal is to understand how to define classes, create objects, and utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in Python.

Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your machine.

A basic understanding of Python syntax, variables, and functions.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm).

Familiarity with basic programming concepts such as loops and conditions.
